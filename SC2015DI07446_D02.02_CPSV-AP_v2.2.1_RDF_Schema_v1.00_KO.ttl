    <dc:description xml:lang="en">The original CPSV-AP was prepared in the context of Action 1.3 – Accessing Member State information resources at European level – Catalogue of Services  of the European Commission’s Interoperability for European Public Administrations (ISA) programme. The CPSV-AP has been seen as a first step for creating a model for describing public services related to business events, to facilitate the set-up of catalogues of services in the context of the Services Directive. Update to version 2.2 finds its motivation in the experience of implementing version 2.1 of the CPSV-AP by different MSs and stakeholders and consequent requests received from them, as detailed in https://github.com/catalogue-of-services-isa/CPSV-AP/issues.</dc:description>

A specific Public Service may require the presence of certain pieces of Evidence in order to be delivered. If the evidence required to make use of a service varies according to the channel through which it is accessed, then Has Input should be at the level of the Channel.</ns0:usageNote>
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Cardinality [0..n]. In the majority of cases, the evidence required to use a Public Service will be independent of the channel through which the service is accessed. The Has Input property should normally be used to link a Public Service directly to one or more pieces of Evidence. However, where the type of Evidence required varies according to the channel used to access the Public Service, then the Has Input property may be used at the Channel level. For example, a digital signature may be required for an online channel, whereas a physical signature may be required for a face to face service provision.</rdfs:comment>

However, this simple structure does not allow statements to be made about those participants, such the start and end date of a contract, nor does it support the inclusion of other roles. The Participation class supports this extra complexity if required, for instance, the description of a service user or a service provider. The model is consistent with the CPOV which in turn is based on the W3C Organization Ontology that supports the common cases simply but allows the complex cases where necessary. The Participation class can be mapped to the Organization Ontology’s Membership class that allows more complex relationships and richer metadata to be applied to a role filled by a given Agent.</ns0:usageNote>

A service exists whether it is used or not, and the term 'benefit' may apply in the sense of enabling the fulfilment of an obligation.
